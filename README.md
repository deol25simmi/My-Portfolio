# My-Portfolio
 Welcome to my portfolio website! This project consists of two files: index.html and mystyle.css. These files contain the HTML and CSS code, respectively, to build and style my portfolio website.

# File Descriptions
 * index.html: This file contains the HTML structure and content of the website. It includes sections such as a navigation menu, introduction, projects, skills, and contact                information. You can customize the content of each section to showcase your own projects, skills, and personal information.

 * mystyle.css: This file contains the CSS styling rules to enhance the visual appearance of the website. It defines the fonts, colors, layouts, and other design elements                   used throughout the site. Feel free to modify the styles to match your personal preferences and branding.

# Getting Started
To use this portfolio website for yourself, follow the instructions below:

  * Download the two files (index.html and mystyle.css) to your local machine.
  * Open index.html in a web browser to see the current version of the website.
  * Open the files in a text editor (such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Notepad++) to make modifications.

# Customization
Here are a few suggestions on how you can customize the portfolio website to make it your own:

* Content: Replace the default projects, skills, and contact information with your own. Update the text, images, and links accordingly.
* Styling: Modify the CSS rules in mystyle.css to change the colors, fonts, sizes, and other visual aspects of the website. Feel free to experiment and make it reflect your personal style.
* Layout: If you want to rearrange the sections or add new ones, you can edit the HTML structure in index.html. Make sure to update the corresponding CSS rules in mystyle.css as well.
